Project Overview
This project aims to help companies avoid failed product launches by analyzing customer sentiment from product reviews. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we identify key complaints, feature requests, and unmet needs. Based on this analysis, we provide actionable recommendations for product adjustments before launch.

Business Problem
Companies often launch products that fail because they donâ€™t understand consumer sentiment. This leads to:

Wasted resources.

Poor customer adoption.

Brand damage.

By analyzing customer sentiment, we can:

Identify key issues before launch.
Make data-driven product adjustments.

Improve customer satisfaction and adoption.

Solution Approach
Data Collection: Use the Amazon Product Reviews dataset from Kaggle.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and preprocess text.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize rating distribution and frequent words.

Sentiment Analysis: Classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

Topic Modeling: Identify key topics in negative reviews using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

Business Recommendations: Provide actionable insights for product adjustments.

Impact Analysis: Highlight the potential business impact of the recommendations

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset from Kaggle. It contains 568,454 food reviews from Amazon up to October 2012.

Dataset Link: Amazon Product Reviews Dataset

Columns Used:

ProductId: Unique identifier for the product.

UserId: Unique identifier for the user.

Score: Rating provided by the user (1 to 5).

Summary: Review headline.

Text: Review body.
Code Implementation
The code is implemented in Python and follows these steps:

Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries for data processing, visualization, and NLP.

Load Dataset: Load the dataset from the CSV file.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and preprocess text.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize rating distribution and generate a word cloud.

Sentiment Analysis: Classify reviews using TextBlob and visualize sentiment distribution.

Topic Modeling: Use TF-IDF and LDA to identify key topics in negative reviews.

Business Recommendations: Provide actionable insights based on the analysis.

Save Results: Save the analyzed data to a CSV file.
Results and Insights
Key Findings
Sentiment Distribution:

Most reviews are positive, but negative reviews provide valuable insights.

Top Topics in Negative Reviews:

Complaints about taste, texture, and packaging.

Issues with delivery and customer service.

Business Recommendations:

Improve product quality and packaging.

Introduce new flavors or variants.

Enhance customer service.

Visualizations
Rating Distribution: A bar chart showing the distribution of product ratings.

Word Cloud: A visualization of the most frequent words in reviews.

Sentiment Distribution: A bar chart showing the distribution of sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).

Business Impact
By implementing the recommendations, companies can:

Prevent Failed Launches: Address key complaints before launch.

Increase Customer Satisfaction: Meet customer needs and expectations.

Boost Revenue: Higher customer adoption and repeat purchases.

Enhance Brand Reputation: Fewer negative reviews and better customer loyalty.
